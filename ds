and point it to the directory

is not yet present in the user's tag file, it is created and pointed to

.B TAG
is redirected to
.B DIR
.

.TP
.BR \-r "," \-\^\-remove-tag ", "remove
Removes all the listed tags from the user's tag file.

.SH DESCRIPTION
ds maintains the tag file
.IB tags
located in the user's directory
.IB \[ti]/.ds
.
The file has two columns: the left one for the tags and the right one for the respective directories. In addition to all the tags, the tag file (usually) has a tag called
.IB zzzPREV
which holds the previously visited directory. This allows ds to "jump" back and forth between two directories simply by invoking the ds without any arguments.

A tag is a string containing no space characters, while directories with spaces are allowed as long as they are surrounded with single or double quotes.

In addition, if the directory starts with a tilde (~), it will be expanded to the name of the user's home directory. In order to keep the tilde character intact, surround the path with single or double quotes.
